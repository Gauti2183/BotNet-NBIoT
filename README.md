# BotNet-NBIoT
Detection of IoT botnet attacks
As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices being deployed worldwide has been increasing rapidly. And the traffic volume of IoT-based DDoS attacks has on the rise as well. The needs for detection of IoT botnet attacks and identifying compromised devices have become imperative for mitigating the risks associated with these attacks. 

#  Data
The dataset consists of a lot of valuable information. The dataset was created by capturing the raw network traffic data (in pcap format) using port mirroring on the switch through which the organizational traffic typically flows [1]. The dataset consists of the same set of 23 features from five-time windows of the most recent 0.01 sec, 0.1 sec , 1 sec, 3 sec, and 5 sec.
